# Task Manager

This is a simple Task Manager program designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. 
Once you run the program, it will show you how many tasks you have due today.
Users can add tasks, edit tasks, view all tasks, delete tasks from the list and add a priority number (1, 2 or 3) to the tasks, depending on how urgent the task is.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can add tasks to the list along with a priority number and due date.
- Edit tasks: Users can edit any task that is currently in the list. They can edit the name of the tasks, the due date of the task or the priority number of the task.
- Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- View all tasks: Users can view all tasks currently in the list.
